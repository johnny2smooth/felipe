      A little message about how it is better. I mean besides the fact that is
      operated by the goat. He has a lot of experience and stuff. He is also my
      cousin so I am a little biased, I'll admit. This is a good place to
      introduce this mf. Also, let's keep it short. We can get into detail
      later. But what is important is that we put his bitmoji here. Down below.
